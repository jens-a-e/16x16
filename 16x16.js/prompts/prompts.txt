abandon normal sequencers and accept advice from your closest enemy
a grid has four corners, but a line has two sides. consider different grid systems
work against your better judgment and move slowly, act quickly
assemble some of the samples into a group and convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element
change instrument roles and define an area as 'safe' and use it as an anchor
discover the recipes you are using and abandon them. do nothing for as long as possible
don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do and don't stress one thing more than another
do something boring and infinitesimal
emphasize differences and emphasize repetitions
faced with a choice, do both and fill every beat with something
give the game away and go slowly all the way round the outside
honor thy error as a hidden intention and thy grid as a hidden sample
how would you have done it? do the words need changing?
humanize something free of error and imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar
listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly and look at a very small object
look at the order in which you do things and make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action
mechanicalize something idiosyncratic and mute and continue
only one element of each kind and (organic) machinery
overtly resist change and trust in the you of now
remember those quiet evenings and shut the door and listen from outside
remove ambiguities and convert to specifics or remove specifics and convert to ambiguities
repetition is a form of change and change is a form of repetition
the inconsistency principle and the grid is now the music
think of the radio and who would listen to this?
tidy up, neaten, polish and use an unacceptable color
use fewer notes and use more notes
how would someone else do it? how would you like it to be?
what would your closest friend do? what is the reality of the situation?
would anyone want to listen to this?
would it make any sense at all?
what would your grandmother say?
what would a child do?
what is the most important thing?
what is the least important thing?
what are you really trying to say?
say it in your own words
say it in the opposite way
take away the elements in order of apparent nonimportance
abandon normal instruments and pick up some bongos
abandon normal sequencers and use your feet
abandon normal grids and use an abacus
a line has two sides, but a circle has none
a grid has four corners, but a triangle has none
are there sections? consider transitions between dimensions
work against your better judgment and do what feels right
assemble some of the samples into a group and have a jam session
move slowly, act quickly and be prepared for anything
cascades of sound will fill the room
cascades of samples will fill your hard drive
change instrument roles and have the drums play the melody
change sample roles and have the melody play the drums
change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency
cluster analysis will reveal the hidden patterns in the data
sample analysis will reveal the hidden patterns in the music
consider different grid systems and use the one that feels right
convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element and vice versa
abandon normal instruments and pick up some kazoos
abandon normal sequencers and make some beats with your bare hands
abandon normal grids and let your mind wander
accept advice from your friends, even if it's terrible
a line has two sides, but it also has a middle
a grid has four corners, but it also has four sides
are there sections? consider transitions, and make them happen
work against your better judgment, and see what happens
assemble some of the samples into a group, and see what they sound like together
move slowly, and act quickly when the opportunity arises
cascades of sound, cascades of samples, let them flow
change instrument roles and see how it affects the sound
change sample roles and see how it affects the sound
change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency
cluster analysis, sample analysis, see what you can find
consider different grid systems and see which one works best
convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element, or vice versa
work against your better judgment
what are you really thinking about right now?
is there something missing? can you take something away?
what are the consequences of this action?
what is the reality of the situation?
how can you make this more interesting?
how can you make this more complex?
how can you make this more simple?
abandon normal coffee and accept advice from your closest enemy
